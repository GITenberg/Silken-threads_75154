<i>THE OLD SAMPLER</i>
</h3>

<p>
Dear little girl of Long Ago, so
sweetly docile, quiet and prim,
making, laboriously and slow, your silken
prayer to Him&mdash;did your child-heart beat
eager wings beneath the bones of your
stiff dress, like some caged bird that
sweetly sings, longing for freedom's
happiness?  It must have been a day
in June when with a gleaming, scarlet
thread, you worked the livelong afternoon,
"Give us this day our daily bread."  For
look!  Just where a line begins your
needle strayed a square too high; quite
crooked are the words "our sins."  Oh! were
you gazing at the sky?  Or did the
daisies on your lawn begin to wink and
blink at you?  Perhaps you spied a
leprechaun just where your mother's
roses grew?  I think God smiled at that
mistake, dear little girl so fair and prim,
and blessed those hands that failed to
make&mdash;a perfect gift for Him.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap06"></a>
<i>EVERYDAY RELIGION</i>
</h3>

<p>
How far you seek, poor soul, to find
your God, through such a maze of
noisy, foolish words, and yet they speak
of Him&mdash;each silent sod, each crooning
breeze, and all the singing birds.  He
dwells not in a tenet or a creed, no roof
can compass Him, nor walls enclose, but
you will find Him in the humblest weed
and in the beauty of a budding rose.
Think you He cares for some
high-sounding phrase, the gift from lips that
serve a subtle mind?  Some homely
household sounds best sing His praise,
and deeds that spring from hearts sincere
and kind.  Why travel such a devious
path and long, when sun and moon and
stars proclaim Him near?  Hark to His
voice, a throbbing, pleading song, bidding
us slay Intolerance and Fear.  Return,
oh soul, from journeying afar; there is a
quiet road, straight to your breast.
Travel this path, at rise of evening star,
you'll find that He has come to be your
guest.
</p>

<i>THE THOROUGHBRED MONGREL</i>
</h3>

<p>
Your tail's absurdly long for a
doggie of your size.  Your ears,
well they look wrong, but the love-light
in your eyes, ah! makes one quite forget
you've won no prize as yet.  You're a
mongrel, little chap, just a mongrel,
nothing more.  Take your paws off from
my lap.  Oh! you silly little bore, must
you make this awful fuss just to show
your love for us?  Your hair is such a
length!  You're clumsy with your feet;
you've tenacity and strength, you're a
ruffian on the street, and you wriggle
like an eel just to show the love you feel.
Mongrel, with no hope of fame, who's
your father?  You don't know?  Ought
to slink away in shame, but the children
love you so, and despite your tail and
head&mdash;you're at heart, a thoroughbred!
</p>

<i>THE WEEK ROUND</i>
</h3>

<p>
Idleness we now must shun, another
week of work begun, another hill that
must be won, for 'tis Monday morning.
Clear in brain and strong in limb, now
we're in good fighting trim, Sunday's
joys are growing dim, for 'tis Tuesday
morning.  Energies have reached the
crest, we've ambition, hope and zest,
work, of all life's gifts the best, on this
Wednesday morning.  Duties pile up
thick and fast, the middle of the week is
past, now our goal's in sight at last, for
'tis Thursday morning.  Smiling, singing,
lift the load, do not let the burden goad,
look ahead&mdash;there ends the road, for 'tis
Friday morning.  Soon we'll fold our
tasks away.  A few more hours and then
to play, to-morrow is a precious
day&mdash;blithe Saturday, good morning!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<a id="chap09"></a>
<i>HER TROUBLESOME HUSBAND</i>
</h3>

<p>
"If only," she said (and wistful her
eyes), "my husband would take a
pride in his ties; but somehow he makes
them look like a string.  I've pleaded,
I've bullied, I can't do a thing.  He'll
never look smart or stylish, I fear&mdash;and
yet, all the same, he's really a dear!"  "Now
why should he wear, year in and
year out, his hat of grey felt the wrong
way about?  And why, when he fastens
his cardigan vest, he should miss the first
buttonhole, I've never guessed.  And
then he's surprised there's one button to
spare!  I plead or I lecture, but he
doesn't care.  He'll never look smart or
stylish, I fear&mdash;and yet, all the same, he's
really a dear!"  "If all his pockets were
merely for looks, and not for his scissors
and pencils and books; for matches, for
pouch, for pipe and for knife&mdash;he'd not
look a lumpy disgrace to his wife.  If he'd
brush his clothes sometimes, use hangers
at night, he'd look like our neighbour, so
smart&mdash;a delight!  He'll never improve,
not the slightest, I fear; but yet, I
assure you, he's really a dear."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap10"></a>
<i>THE STRING BAG</i>
</h3>

<p>
A task to irritate a saint&mdash;unravelling
string of every length!  Before
all's done, perhaps I'll faint; it's such a
tax upon one's strength.  This piece
seems boastful of its knot, as if it knows
it hurt my nails.  Dear me!  This bag
does hold a lot; my courage flags and
fails.  But, after all&mdash;it's rather fun.
Suppose this string is but a street.
Ah! now my journey's well begun; each knot
a mountain at my feet.  Till these be
scaled, I can't progress.  I clench my
teeth and work away, beyond this knot
lies happiness, and I must pass while yet
'tis day.  Another piece leads to a hill
where fairy folk in tree trunks dwell.
I'll blaze this trail with right good will,
and live among them for a spell.  So
swift my fingers work, and fast (imagination's
on the wing!) and all my troubles
fade at last&mdash;for life is like a knotted
string!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap11"></a>
<i>LIFE GROWS FAIRER</i>
</h3>

<p>
As life goes by it fairer grows.  Oh,
yes, it fairer grows to me.  And
may it be so at the close when Death
advances lovingly.  It is not greater
pomp nor state, nor high ambitions well
attained, nor any stroke of lucky fate,
nor wealth that Midas-like I've gained.
Material gains I have not known (my
bank account's about the same!) and
yet the world has fairer grown; with
certainty I make this claim.  In love and
tenderness and grace, the world grows
fairer day by day.  What joy to see a
friendly face as we go bravely on our
way.  Not cleverness, nor knowledge,
wit, do much enhance this life of ours
(of course I know they help a bit), but
God be thanked for sun and flow'rs; for
peace beneath the star-strewn skies; for
friends who sit around one's fire; for
books, amusing, helpful, wise; for Love
that crowns the heart's desire.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap12"></a>
<i>TO THE FIRST-BORN</i>
</h3>

<p>
Lovely was life, and seemingly
complete!  Such happiness was ours
and deep content.  The days flew by like
buoyant birds and fleet: Joy was the
urge to every fresh intent.  No hours to
waste, we had so much to do; Life was
our teacher and we loved her well; loved
every sound and every shade and hue;
always she wove some new and potent
spell.  And then the blinding miracle&mdash;you
came.  A crumpled rose leaf, funny
little thing, no teeth, no hair, no words,
not e'en a name, and yet our hearts with
ecstasy did sing.  A tiny bundle.  Eight
pounds in a shawl!  And yet you caused
so swift and great a change, became the
pulse of life, our joy, our all.  We lived
without you once, how very strange!
Then was all beauty symbolised by you.
Then did we find all joys on earth, above,
wrapped in a shawl; and then at last we
knew the meaning of that phrase, "Lo!
God is Love."
</p>

<a id="chap13"></a>
<i>A LITTLE CHILD'S PRAYER</i>
</h3>

<p>
My prayer is such a little thing, it
might get lost and go astray.  Are
you, dear God, now listening to what I
say?  I wish to thank You for the sun
that kissed, this morn, my sleeping eyes;
for all the happy things I've done since I
did rise.  For gift of sound and gift of
sight; for feet that skip so merrily; for
food and warmth, and each delight You
gave to me.  I thank You for my mother
dear; I thank You for my father kind;
and for the star that watches near&mdash;behind
the blind.  So many Grown-ups
show me love, though I'm a child and still
quite small.  Look down upon them
from above and, please God, bless them
all.  And now, dear God, I'll say
"Good-night," and may Your angels guard my
bed until You send Your morning light
to wake this Sleepy Head.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
<a id="chap14"></a>
<i>THE BEDROOM'S WELCOME</i>
</h3>

<p>
I bid you welcome, Friend!  This
thought is joy to me: that you should
seek my sympathy, at the day's end.
My walls&mdash;they will enfold you with
tenderness and grace.  Maternal arms
are they to hold you in warm and safe
embrace.  Here you may cast aside the
cares you had; discard them like old
garments, drab and worn.  In robes of
peace, until to-morrow morn, now be
you clad!  See what sweet dreams I
have called forth for you.  They are the
lovely shadows in the room; and on the
walls, like fairy flowers they'll bloom,
the whole night through.  And some will
hover gently o'er your head; and some
press softly 'gainst your sleeping heart;
and you will travel to a magic mart&mdash;a
Dreamship is your bed.  I bid you
welcome, Guest!  Hold out your hands
to me, a loving friend.  For now, Tired
Soul, the day is at an end&mdash;and I will
give you rest.
</p>

<i>THE TEACHER</i>
</h3>

<p>
There's Amy, Daphne, Pam, and
Rose; Elizabeth and Lucille fair;
and Jellis with tip-tilted nose; Amanda
with rich auburn hair.  And other
blossoms, row on row, standing so primly in
their places.  It sets the teacher's heart
aglow to see their morning-glory faces.
Now like a mother she must be&mdash;a loving
mother wise and kind&mdash;clothing each
tender memory in prettiest garments
she can find.  As mothers joy in dainty
frills, so will she trim each baby heart
with melodies and lilting trills, borrowed
for them, from Beauty's mart.  For
ribbons&mdash;phrases gleaming bright, most
beautiful to hear and say; each one a
streamer of delight with which a little
soul can play!  For food&mdash;she proffers
Truth's white bread.  For drink&mdash;the
Spirit's sparkling stream.  With fairy-lore
is Fancy fed, that they, her bairns,
may sweetly dream.

<i>PATRICIA ANN'S GARDEN</i>
</h3>

<p>
Lupins from Patricia Ann!  She,
though barely seven, has a garden
of her own, a little bit of heaven.
Blossoms that she grew for me&mdash;so her little
letter ran&mdash;what gift could more lovely
be.  Lupins from Patricia Ann!  Purple,
pink and ivory white, here is one with
tint of rose; did they, Pat, o'er-top your
height, though you stood on tippy-toes?
Thoughts are wandering for a span round
about a vase of blue.  Lupins from
Patricia Ann&mdash;can I help but think of
you.  Patricia Ann!  Throughout your
days you a gardener must be.  Gardeners
have gentle ways, all their thoughts make
melody.  As your destined path you take,
and places you must scan; there, sow
seeds for love's own sake, blossoms from
Patricia Ann!

"<i>BLESSED ARE THEY</i>"
</h3>

<p>
"Blessed are they who are pleasant
to live with."  Blessed are
they who sing in the morning, whose
faces have smiles for their early adorning,
who come down to breakfast companioned
by Cheer, who won't dwell on
trouble, nor entertain fear, whose eyes
smile forth bravely, whose lips curve to
say, "Life!  I salute you.  Good-morrow,
New Day!"  "Blessed are they who
are pleasant to live with."  Blessed are
they who treat one another, though
merely a sister, a father, a brother, with
the very same courtesy they would
extend to a casual acquaintance, or
dearly-loved friend; who choose for the
telling encouraging things, and choke
back the bitter, the sharp word that
stings.  "Blessed are they who are
pleasant to live with."  Blessed are they
who give of their best, who bring to the
home bright laughter, gay jest, who
make themselves charming for no other
reason than charm is a blossom for
homes, every season!  Who bestow love
on others throughout the long day&mdash;pleasant
to live with and blessed are they!

<i>A MOTHER SPEAKS</i>
</h3>

<p>
A lovely photograph?  Ah, yes!
But still it does not show the sun
turning to copper each brown tress&mdash;but
I have seen this done.  You cannot
see how in each cheek a laughing dimple
comes and goes and plays a game of
hide-and-seek in petals of a rose.  You
cannot see the bright star-shine within
her beaming hazel eyes; nor see the
colour, like red wine, denote a glad
surprise.  You have not watched her
body's grace, its perfect, joyous
symmetry; nor have you glimpsed her
sleeping face, turned happily to me.
My baby's photograph.  Ah, yes!  But
you should hear her lilting voice with
tones that break with happiness and
make the birds rejoice.  You have not
felt her tiny hand caress your cheek;
nor known her kiss.  But if you had,
you'd understand&mdash;she's lovelier, far,
than this!

<i>THE BOY SAMUEL</i>
</h3>

<p>
He must have been a lonely little boy.
The cold stone Temple for a nursery
floor, and the Sanctuary Lamp for a
glittering toy, and a Tamarix tree by the
Temple door.  (A Tamarix tree with
scarcely a leaf to comfort a homesick
child in his grief.)  No woman's lips on
his baby face; no woman's arms to hug
him tight.  Who put his sandals, each
night, in place, and hung up his ephod,
small and white?  (Sometimes, I fear,
when the old priest slept, the little child
Samuel wept and wept.)  What did he
think, when once a year, Hannah, the
mother, with love-lit eyes, held him close
and whispered, "Dear!  See, I have
brought my babe a prize," and gave him
a coat that she had made (I hope it was
cut of rich brocade!)  I hope it had
friendly birds and flow'rs, embroidered
in threads of blue and gold, playmates
for his long, lonely hours in the silent
Temple dim and cold.  With such a
coat to wear and touch&mdash;he might not
miss his mother much.

<i>THE PERFECT FRIEND</i>
</h3>

<p>
Shabby and down at heel?  What
does he care, so long as he can steal
next to my chair?  Sombre and dull of
wit; feeling morose?  He doesn't mind
a bit, snuggles up close.  Silence I may
require.  He's quite content.  Silence is
his desire, till my mood's spent.  Ready
to run a race, swim, fetch a stone.  Yet
will, with perfect grace, leave me alone.
Some folks oft misconstrue words we let
fall.  Alter the shade and hue, turn sweet
to gall.  Not so this friend of mine; he
understands.  Gives me his secret sign,
licks both my hands!  Never misjudges,
trusts to the end, pattern of
loyalty&mdash;Doggie, the Friend.

<i>MAKING THE BEST OF IT</i>
</h3>

<p>
The day was like a garment that I
perforce must wear.  I didn't like
its colour much, it didn't suit my hair.
I didn't like its line or cut, it didn't please
my eye.  "You look so very drab and
mean," said I with heavy sigh.  But
since I had to wear it, this garment made
for me, I said: I will embellish it and
trim it prettily.  Around its neck I
stitched some smiles, a frill of them, all
gold.  And at the wrists, bright fancy's
braid, quite lovely to behold.  I girdled
it with rosy dreams ('tis wrong to look a
dowd!) and for a little 'kerchief, I chose
a snow-white cloud.  I gathered shining,
gleaming thoughts and looped them here
and there.  The day it was a garment
that I just loved to wear.

Here's to the hour the striving ends and
we stake our claim to the heart's delight.
Here's to the road that winds afar, here's

<i>THE GARDENER'S PRAYER</i>
</h3>

<p>
I pray You, let this garden be a
gentle advocate for me before Your
throne.  Lord, it is fair and orderly and
through its sweet serenity, my faults I
own.  My life at times has gone awry,
but here beneath Your arch of sky, the
pattern's true.  The wind that softly
passes by; tall trees, bright blossoms,
grass, all try to pleasure You.  With
zest I've weeded day by day.  Judge
that my sins I cast away and am now
shriven.  And here Your sunbeams come
to play, and moonbeams on this path do
stray.  Your stars look down from
heaven.  Will You not take this pattern
bright as handiwork for Your delight and
bless this little garden?  See how the
lilies tall and white stand unafraid
within Your sight, and ask, for me, Your
pardon.

<i>LEGS AND ARMS</i>
</h3>

<p>
A curious thing, but a fact all the
same, some friends of mine (never
mind what name) thought of nothing and
talked of naught but a William and Mary
chair they'd bought.  And also a table,
a tallboy, a chest, with which they had
furnished the room for a guest.
Whenever I visited just for a span, 'twas
"William and Mary" or good "Queen
Anne."  'Twas "Heppelwhite" this and
"Chippendale" that.  I soon had the
periods learnt off pat.  They looked at a
leg, "Cup-turned," they said, and bade
me observe their Sheraton bed.  But now
all's changed, and the reason's this.
There's a little curved leg they love to
kiss; there's a dimpled arm so smooth
and white, its graceful contour gives
delight.  And as for the chest, it gives
much joy.  Says Daddy, "Just look at
this fine tall boy!"  Of Seventeenth
Century they don't speak.  Everything
dates from just last week.  For period
furniture lost its hold&mdash;since they have
acquired a One-Week-Old.

A lotion, madam, for your eyes?
Oh, certainly, come this way, please.
You'll use this one if you are wise.  Its
chief ingredients are these: Ten drops of

cooling brew, mixed by a scented breeze.
And next?  A face cream?  Come this

It can work wonders in a day, yet quite
an inexpensive blend.  One ounce of
laughter, smiles and twinkles.  'Tis
guaranteed to smooth out wrinkles.  I thank
you, madam.  Take or send?  For jaded
nerves?  A recipe?  I've this that all
my clients heed.  A draught of wholesome
sympathy for someone else's urgent
need; forgetfulness of your own cares by
thinking of world brotherhood&mdash;though

<i>THE FIRST BIRTHDAY</i>
</h3>

<p>
It's all as strange as it can be, and
Baby wonders, silently.  Mother hugs
him even more than she ever did before.
Father has such boisterous ways, bellows
words of petting praise, flings him high
into the air.  "Oh!" shrieks mother,
"do take care."  'Tis four o'clock, he's
been to sleep and yet he's not allowed to
creep; not allowed the happiness of
sucking bits of his clean dress.  He has
to sit in his high chair and let a lot of
people stare.  They bring him things to
touch and squeeze, and sister plagues him
to say "please."  Then someone cries,
"Now, Baby, look!  Here is a lovely
picture book."  And someone else says,
"Here's a bunny, a soft, white woolly
one, for Sonny."  He's feeling bored.
He thinks he'll cry.  Just then he catches
mother's eye.  She lifts him up,
oh! pretty sight, a little candle burning
bright!  And Mummie whispers in his
ear, "It's your first birthday, precious
dear."

Many things in this world are bad,
no good looking the other way,
lots of things to make us sad&mdash;but it's
very fine to-day.  Loads of troubles come
to us, you've had yours and I've had
mine.  We won't brood and fret and
fuss&mdash;for to-day is very fine.  Chilly when
the winter's here, and no leaf is on the
bough.  Let us sing a song of cheer&mdash;for
it's very pleasant now.  Life is often
cruel, unkind.  Vainly seek we for the
light.  Gusts of passion fog the
mind&mdash;but, just now, the sun shines bright.
Let's not brood on grief that's past,
shadows fall but shadows lift.  Only
Love and Goodness last&mdash;let's enjoy

Your pardon, Life, if we have

sulky will, choosing an ugly way, though
you have offered for our errant feet a
well-built, clean, a straight and smiling
street!  Your pardon, Life, if we have
failed to see the beauty of each hour; if
we have walked with eyes turned
inwardly, blind to a bird or flow'r; to all
the loveliness you offered us.  Your
pardon, Life, if we have acted thus.  And
if we have, one moment, turned deaf ears
to voices that inspire; if we have
entertained pale, cowardly fears and fanned a
low desire; if we have brought to naught
one gift you gave, your pardon, Life, we
crave.  Oh, hear us, Life, if we have
acted ill, in deed or thought along the

strengthened will&mdash;and tarnish not your

THE FAMILY DOCTOR
</h3>

<p>
He has no time to "specialise," is
quite unknown to fame; he's understanding,
kindly, wise, and "doctor" is
his name.  Always at patients' beck and
call, all hours of day and night, for both
momentous ills and small&mdash;and oft with
death to fight.  Not always is it draughts
to drink, his trusting patients need.  He
tries to make the thoughtless think&mdash;'tis
sometimes hearts that bleed.  The
honoured confidant and friend of families is
he, and often when for him they send,
they crave but sympathy.  "Doctor,"
one says, "will make the lad see reason
quickly, dear."  Doctor is asked to
soften Dad, or cast out mother's fear.
Their joys and sorrows he doth share, for
doctor always must be told; he lightens
many a heavy care, and this for love,
not gold.  And he mends broken spirits,
too, dispenses cheer and mirth.  The
every-ready friend and true&mdash;the very
salt of earth.

Oh Eyes! let nothing pass.  The
dew-kissed morning grass is a very lovely
sight.  Then there are stars at night;
and a little child at play is a twinkling
star for day!  Oh Ears! drink in the
sounds with which this world abounds.
Not music only, no, not this alone.  For
what more lovely than the throbbing
tone of human voice that blends tenderly
with voice of friends?  Oh Soul! garner
most zealously each quiet joy, each
ecstasy, each sound, each touch, each
sight, whate'er has given delight.  Then
when the summer days of life draw to a
close, from Memory's fair garden&mdash;we

<i>MY TRUANT SHADOW</i>

I envied little girls to-day: I envied
little boys.  For part of me just
longed to play with Springtime's jolly
toys.  I longed to have a hoop to bowl,
a spinning top and whip, a bright red ball
to bounce and roll&mdash;a rope so I might skip.
A rope with handles very gay, on each a
painted rose.  Then little girls who passed
my way would say, "Oh! look at those!"  But
I, alas! this morning walked with
silly, grown-up tread; so wisely my
companion talked, such solemn things he
said.  But suddenly my shadow tripped
a little way ahead.  And with a brand
new rope it skipped&mdash;I feared it would
drop dead.  So fast it skipped, such
slender feet, it really made me wince.
And then it skipped across the street;
I have not seen it since.  But what it's
doing I can guess, that naughty, truant,
Shadow-me!  It's spinning tops
(oh! happiness) and bowling hoops with
ecstasy!

<i>TO CAT PETER</i>

<p>
My Peter!  It is time I told you
flat, just what I think of species
known as cat.  Throughout the centuries,
from earliest days, mere human-beings
have sung loud your praise.  Beloved of
popes the cat has often been; sacred in
Egypt; petted by king or queen.  And
you, you orphan, common little stray,
accept the homage that we weakly pay
as if it were your just and proper due.
I am disgusted, quite annoyed with you.
What do you do for us, I'd like to know?
You care not when or where we come or
go.  You show no joy when we return at
night, but blink your eyes, and are
indifferent, quite.  You stalk into the
kitchen, drink your milk, then lick your
paws until they shine like silk; sit in a
sunny window, catch a fly; then, feeling
bored, leap to a shelf on high, and from
this prominence you view with scorn&mdash;those
who have served with love since
you were born!

<i>IN THE BEGINNING</i>

<p>
In the beginning was the seed.  And
silently the work went on.  The roots
struck deep; new life was freed; the
warm rain fell; the bright sun shone.
A tiny shoot; two leaves of green;
growth hour by hour&mdash;and then the
day when all the glory of a flower was
seen.  The deed perfected in true
beauty's way, for not a single word had
yet been heard!  Grant us the power to
act this way.  Let each good impulse
strike upon rich soil, and there take root
and blossom through the day not by the
breath of words but silent toil.  For
gracious words should follow what we
do, the lovely blossoms of a fruitful
deed; or like the sun's exquisite farewell
hue, beauty that is of service, the just
meed.  "First, we will act."  This is the
best of creeds.  For words draw life after
the good is done; and flash within the
sunlight of our deeds like rays reflected
from the spirit's sun.

perfect shoe.  Wasn't done quickly, lad,
admit; persistence needed and strength
and grit.  That is the way we all must
work (no use tiring nor trying to shirk).
Not for an hour, not for a day; nor for
a week, nor month, nor year; just how
long no one can say (keep on, laddie,
success is near), hammer away, boy,
hammer away.  Look how ambition's

A window filled with naught but
shoes of every shape and every

hues&mdash;they claimed my fascinated eyes.
I simply had to stand and stare (would
you believe me, in the rain!), I had no
wish to buy a pair, indeed, I have a
foolish brain.  But this is why I could
not go: I could not tear myself away,
I felt a great desire to know where all
these shoes would wend one day.  And
while the raindrops, laughing, fell, I stood
and mused a little while.  This pair, oh,
anyone could tell, would walk for many
a business mile, and those would mince
along the street as proud as proud as they
could be; and these, they were for
dancing feet.  Perhaps (hoped I) they'll
dance with me!  Just then a cosy pair
I spied.  Ah, they would meet my heart's

little girl of three.  I can remember
(Oh!  I'm full of shame) picking big holes
in mother's gingerbread.  And when she
asked me for the culprit's name, "It
must have been the flies," I calmly said.
I can remember a laburnam tree spanning
a river with its arch of gold.  And stored
for ever in my memory are all the Fairy
Tales my father told.  I'll ne'er forget a
little magic door, a little shiny gate of
yellow wood.  Through it I passed
whene'er the clock struck four (provided that
I really had been good).  Then down a
hill, quite steep and very wide, a perilous

The heart is like a quiet port expecting
ships each day.  The spirit is the
armoured fort that guards the ocean way.
For, sometimes, on the sea of life there
rides an evil ship.  The crew belongs to
Captain Strife, who shows a bitter lip.
Dead Hopes and Fears and shattered
Dreams, his cargo in the hold; above his
ship a vulture screams, the wind blows
keen and cold.  Then Coastguard Spirit
calls with zest, "Oh, heart of mine,
beware, let not this vessel come to rest,
'twill bring you black despair."  One
day, when lovely is the sky, a ship sails
into view.  Its banner, Courage, floats
on high, and joyous is the crew.  'Tis
Captain Youth with dreams of yore, how
gently he doth speak.  Oh, gallant ship,
pull into shore, my heart's the port you
seek.

Who made you?  Was she old or

was sung (as she worked) a love song or
a hymn?  You think, old quilt, in vain
I probe and ask?  But like a mirror you
reflect it all.  For I can see her at her
homely task, sweet-faced and comely, fair
and queenly tall.  And there were toddlers
pressed against her knee, their rosy fingers
petting each bright hue.  One trilled,
"That pretty scarlet piece is meant for
me."  Another, "May I have this lovely
blue?"  How clear it is she loved all
outdoor things.  So many shades of sky
she's brought together; touches of
crimson seen on blackbirds' wings; the
greens of trees; soft greys of rainy
weather.  And here is mauve, a wistful,
gentle shade, when she felt weary and a
little sad.  Ah, me!  This brown is
serious and staid, but yellow smiles
and proves that she grew glad.  But
when she reached the borders then, I
think, she chose the blue to match a
midnight sky, and silver snippets for the
stars that wink; and, as she stitched,
she sang a lullaby.

<i>MY OLD DOLL</i>
</h3>

<p>
"Too old," they cried, "with dolls
to play."  And so I gently laid
away the doll my father bought for me
when I was only half past three.  One
day, I mused, my own wee girl may hug
that doll and kiss each curl.  How could
I tell a roguish boy would treat with
scorn my childhood's joy?  One spring,
when tidying things anew, my dolly came
again to view.  I hugged her and I
smoothed her head.  "You'll go to
Barbara," I said.  "My niece, my golden
Babs, is four, she'll love you as I did of
yore."  But when it came to paper,
string, I felt my eyes with salt tears
sting.  I put that dolly back again!
Absurd?  I know.  But oh! the pain.
Then later, when a year had passed, I
took that doll, and held her fast.  Said
I, "To little Ruth you'll go, that niece
of mine will love you so."  I smoothed
her dress and ironed her lace&mdash;then put
her back in her old place.  It's very,
very clear to me, the little girl I used to
be refuses to relinquish Moll, the first,
and last, and best-loved Doll!

<i>LITTLE ROADS TO HAPPINESS</i>
</h3>

<p>
The little roads to happiness, they
are not hard to find; they do not
lead to great success&mdash;but to a quiet
mind.  They do not lead to mighty power
nor to substantial wealth.  They bring
one to a book, a flower, a song of cheer
and health.  The little roads to happiness
are free to everyone; they lead one to
the wind's caress, to kiss of friendly sun.
These little roads are shining white, for
all the world to see; their sign-boards,
pointing left and right, are love and
sympathy.  The little roads of happiness
have this most charming way; no matter
how they may digress throughout the
busy day; no matter where they twist
and wind through fields of rich delight,
they're always of the self-same mind to
lead us home at night.

<i>FRIENDSHIP AND SUSPICION</i>
</h3>

<p>
Friendship and Suspicion cannot
dwell together.  Friendship loves the
sun; Suspicion, cloudy weather.  Friendship
needs must trust; Suspicion has to
doubt, and, seeking hidden faults, turn
all things inside out.  Friendship clings
to Truth, which is Suspicion's foe.  'Tis
Truth that feeds the wick for Friendship's
steady glow.  No matter what the problem,
ah!  Friendship understands.  And
proffers ready helpfulness with eager,
outstretched hands.  And never questions
coldly, nor probes with bitter sneer,
but eases every burden, dispels each
chilly fear.  Friendship seeks companions,
Suspicion walks alone, eyelids drooping
meanly, in his heart, a stone.  Friendship's
joy is service, fair or foul the
weather.  Suspicion turns from
giving&mdash;so they cannot dwell together.

<i>THE WORTHY CREW</i>
</h3>

<p>
Discontented?  Job no good?
Chief is never praising you?  Going
elsewhere?  Wish you could?  Feeling
bitter, tired and blue?  Sure you're
meant for bigger things.  Never get a
chance, that's all.  Long to use
ambition's wings; feel you're up against a
wall?  Only just occurred to you&mdash;well,
you scarcely like to ask&mdash;but, after all,
what <i>does</i> he do, what is the Chief's
important task?  Quite convinced you
do the most?  Confident you should
earn more?  Of course, you do not like
to boast&mdash;you've other chances, by the
score!  When this mood has you in
grip (as some day it's bound to do),
remember&mdash;a successful ship must carry,
too, a worthy crew.  When this mood
nags at your heart, reflect&mdash;we can't
all captains be; each must play his
special part; ships need crews when off
to sea.

<i>THE POSTMAN</i>
</h3>

<p>
He is the aide-de-camp of merchandise.
While thousands calmly lie
a-bed and dream, he bears the seeds of
some great enterprise from which springs
forth a money-making scheme!
Ambassador from Friendship's court is he,
bearing those greetings that enrich the
day with happy thoughts, and with
sweet melody which, on the heart-strings,
only friends can play.  Life's messenger!
And so he needs must bring echoes from
Sorrow's Hall as well as Joy.  We hold
no grudge against him for the sting,
knowing all happiness has its alloy.
Greater than Mercury who served the
gods, the sturdy Postman, of our busy
days.  Wingless, on patient feet, he
daily plods, evoking from all hearts a
word of praise.  He is the very pulse of
life for all; without his letters we would
be as dumb.  No interchange of thoughts,
how life would pall.  Oh, joyous sound,
the Postman has just come!

"<i>ANGELS IN THE SNOW</i>"
</h3>

<p>
I would go back to Canada, at this
time of the year, for three things, just
three things, my memory holds most
dear.  And this, I say, is one of them:
a blanket of white snow, a-glistening
with diamonds, and the breakfast sun
aglow!  A smooth, white blanket
undisturbed except where Bunny's feet
have pricked a pattern from a bush,
right to a human street!  And this, I
say is two of them: to see bare branches
dressed in fluffy, frozen, flakes of snow
when pink clouds blush the west.  And
this, I say, is three of them, and this I
long to see: the woolly-armoured toddlers,
playing so merrily.  With arms
outstretched they fall down flat, and lie there,
laughing so.  And when they rise, each
leaves behind "an angel in the snow"!

<i>TO MONDAY MORNING</i>

<p>
Good morning, Monday!  Welcome,
Sir!  Indeed, I'm glad to see you
here.  They utter treason who aver you
are devoid of joy and cheer.  That
Monday feeling&mdash;well, it's this: Hurrah! the
week has now begun and who can
say what luck and bliss will come our
way e'er set of sun.  A brand new week
with work to do, and past mistakes all
swept away; our energies strung up
anew to meet and greet the unknown
day.  This morn when sleep dropped
from my eyes, I felt a most delightful
thrill.  I saw, to my intense surprise&mdash;a
guest upon my window-sill.  He'd one
leg out and one leg in (he'd opened up
the window wide), I liked his merry,
carefree grin, and so I begged him step
inside.  'Twas you, oh, Monday.  Welcome,
Sir!  Your presence fills me with
great glee; my pulses with excitement
stir&mdash;I wonder what you've brought
for me.

<i>SECURITIES</i>
</h3>

<p>
One thing there is more Greek than
Greek to my bemused and puzzled
brain.  I read it daily, week by week,
but never is its meaning plain.  It is the
column that one sees naming securities
galore.  There's oil and rubber&mdash;several
teas&mdash;and gold in far-off Labrador.
Those fractions!  How they puzzle me.
I must confess they make me laugh.
How can there be security in what is
listed minus half?  You scorn my denseness,
clever Sir?  There's just this thing
I have to say.  The stocks I own, I much
prefer&mdash;such splendid dividends they
pay.  I've many shares in mines of
mirth, in sunshine, air and flowers and
sky, in all the things of sterling worth,
yes, very rich indeed am I.  I've neither
copper, tin, nor gold; nor platinum
without alloy.  I own what can't be
bought or sold&mdash;for I have many shares
in Joy.

<i>WHEN DECEMBER COMES</i>
</h3>

<p>
December with her skirts a-blowing,
frozen dew-drops in each ear;
berries at her breast a-glowing,
rosy-cheeked December's here.  Hoar-frost
to her garments clinging, prettier gems
she could not find; merrily, December's
singing songs best suited to her mind.
Songs of mistletoe and holly; songs of
labels, paper, string; loving thoughts and
Gayhearts folly&mdash;and just a tiny hint of
Spring!  December bears herself right
proudly, Amazonian Queen is she.  Hear
her laughing, long and loudly&mdash;boisterous
winds her minstrelsy.  December's crown
is bright and gleaming, Jack Frost made
it for a gift.  Just like stars her eyes are
beaming, mouth has such a happy lift!
December knows that we adore her.
Joyfully she goes her way; eleven
sisters march before her&mdash;in her train
comes Christmas Day.

<i>THE LITTLE SHOPS</i>

<p>
Oh, smiling god of Good Luck, now
night has slipped away, look down
upon the little shops, and help them
through the day.  The shutters have
been taken down and polished are the
window-panes; the brasses glow, the
front is swept&mdash;smile, god of Luck, till
daylight wanes.  The little shops pull at
one's heart, so simple is their merchandise.
A little window beckons us through
which we peer with misted eyes.  For
narrow shops are often kind to tiny folk
scarce counter-high.  Above a shop,
behind a blind, I've heard a little baby
cry.  Above a shop, I've often seen a
mother's anxious face appear.  How
many customers have been?  The closing
hour is drawing near.  Great shops, like
temples dedicate to merchandise from
every mart, are over-lords of their own
fate&mdash;but little shops tug at the heart!

<i>SUMMER IN YOUR HEART</i>
</h3>

<p>
What's the sense of fretting because
the sun's forgetting almost every
day to play his part?  What care you
for the weather, let it rain and hail
together, if there's summer time a-shining
in your heart.  No wonder you feel
weary if you think that life is dreary
just because a bitter wind decides to
blow.  What care you for the weather,
come snow and fog together, if the heart
of you with sunshine is aglow.  What's
the sense of sighing because Old Time is
trying to turn your darksome hair to
solemn grey?  He can't rob you of your
youth when your spirit is, forsooth, a
shining, flaunting banner bright and gay.
Let Father Time grow fleeter, the years
will prove but sweeter, though youth&mdash;it
is thus ordered&mdash;must depart.  Life
has no winter season, for this very sound
good reason&mdash;one can always have the
summer in one's heart!

<i>APRIL, THE JESTER</i>

Hark to April's merry laughter!
Glad is she to reach this earth.
Perhaps she'll weep a minute after&mdash;sorrow
often follows mirth.  Not to-day,
though, will she sorrow; she's our
Jester, queen of fun.  Time enough to
weep to-morrow, when her roguishness
is done.  Cap and bells is April wearing,
Punchinello in her hand; jokes with
Brother Wind she's sharing, mortals
cannot understand.  Oh! beware of
April's laughter; trust her not, she is
not true.  First she laughs&mdash;a minute
after, she will make a fool of you.  Now
I've warned you, you'll be clever, quite
prepared for April's wit.  Let her whisper
"Perfect weather," you'll not be deceived
by it!  April her attire is flaunting, cap
and bells and motley gay; and her smile
is mocking, taunting&mdash;April's fools are
we to-day.  Play the Jester, little April,
just for four and twenty hours.  Then
to duty, naughty April&mdash;earth awaits
your smiles and show'rs.

<i>THE SONG OF THE SOUL</i>

<p>
"I have put on mine armour," sings
the soul.  "The flashing armour of
will to do the Right.  Thus I go forth,
not blindly t'wards the goal, but guided
safely, by the Light."  "Righteousness
for armour," cries the soul.  "Beauty
and Truth&mdash;the longed-for goal."  "Beneath
mine armour," chants the soul,
"I've donned a scarlet tunic for my
spirit's sake.  In scarlet tunic, to the
great Beyond, with courage flaming, to
the road I take.  Righteousness for
armour, flashing bright; a scarlet tunic&mdash;for
courage in the night."  "I will go
forth and in this armour clad to meet
Temptation, that most subtle foe.  Like
David of Bethlehem, the shepherd lad,
sure of my strength and power, I go.
And in the stream of Truth I'll find
missiles to fling against Goliath's mind.
I have put on my armour: Truth my
sword; Slave unto none, but Captained
by the Lord."

<i>A BED-TIME SONG</i>
</h3>

<p>
Sleepy shadows fear to fall, so they
lean against the wall, while the tall
dock in the hall sings: "'Tis time
for bed."  Wooden hills we now must
climb.  Up we go, two at a time, singing
such a sleepy rhyme, little Curly Head.
Wooden hills, clip-clop, clip-clop.  First
a jump, and then a hop.  Now we've
reached the very top, nursery fire glows
red.  Sleepy town we've reached at last,
dreamland's ship is anchored fast, rosy
fancies fly the mast, prayers must now
be said.  Weigh the anchor, off you go.
Dreamland's miles away, you know.
Little dreams as white as snow wait for
Curly Head.  Sleepy shadows fear to fall,
lean against the nursery wall, and to one
another call: "Sleepy Head's in bed!"

My House!  I give you thanks
tonight for one year's comfort and
delight.  I thank the sturdy walls and
beams that have enclosed my quiet
dreams.  I thank the windows through
which came pale shafts of light and
sunset's flame.  The dining-room I thank
as well, where I my hunger did dispel!
I thank my bedroom, papered blue, for
when sore wearied through and through,
it spoke to me: "O Sleepy Head, I bid
you welcome to your bed."  I give the
floors a grateful glance for every joyous
whirling dance.  The fireplace owns my
thankful heart&mdash;what comfort from its
depths can dart!  What dreams I've
dreamt when near its blaze; what
pictures seen as I would gaze within the
birch-log's flames of gold that leapt like
dragons fierce and bold.  But most of all
I thank the door&mdash;the thick front door,
oak at its core, because for twelve months
now on end it has let in some dear-loved
friend!

<i>TO A FLORIST'S WINDOW</i>
</h3>

<p>
How often have I paused to bless
your vivid, glowing loveliness!  Have
paused to say a "Thank you, window-pane,"
because despite a sullen fog or
driving rain, I still have had my glimpse
of Paradise through your untroubled,
bright, reflecting eyes.  My heart was
sad when vanished summer days.  I
came to you and stood a silent while, and
felt uplifted on the wings of praise.  Rich
autumn tints, God bless your golden
smile!  Once when a blackish mood
enveloped me, sprays of white lilac arched
your shining pane; the beauty of their
curves spoke tenderly; and I passed on,
happy, revived again.  And now 'tis
glorious tulip time with you!  Yesterday
their happy colours beckoned me.  Rose
pink and mauve and sunlight's golden
hue.  Did you, quiet window-pane, not
feel the ecstasy that flooded all my being
while I stood to bless a florist's
window&mdash;as all city pilgrims should?

<i>TWO COINS</i>

<p>
I had two coins offered me, they shone
like gold, they shone like gold.  I
clutched at them so greedily, I clutched
at them with fevered hold.  I hid them
quickly out of sight.  They were for me
alone to see.  They gave delight, such
keen delight; I hoarded them most
miserly.  One day, alack! and oh! alas! I
took them from their secret place; a
sorry thing had come to pass; my
bright gold coins were dull of face.  I
tended them with loving hand.  Oh! shine
again, be bright again!  This fact
I could not understand: their gleam and
sheen were on the wane.  "I will not
hoard you any more," to them I sighed,
to them I cried.  I shared with one, with
two, with four; with all the friends
whom I espied.  Now this is strange but
this is true.  My wealth is more instead
of less; I spent and spent&mdash;and still it
grew.  Those coins were Love and
Happiness!

<i>THE STREET SINGER</i>

Truth went singing down the street;
on his head a golden crown, broken
sandals on his feet, shabby, too, his
flowing gown.  "Truth," I shouted,
"wait for me.  I desire to learn your
song."  Nought cared he for my poor
plea; just went hurrying along.  "Truth,"
I gasped, quite out of breath, "I can't
hear the words you sing."  "You will
learn them ere your death," was the jibe
he stopped to fling.  "Truth," I prayed
him, "wait awhile.  I have followed you
for years.  Sometimes you have made
me smile, sometimes caused me bitter
tears.  Do, I pray you, let me learn
what it is you sing to-day."  Then at
last he deigned to turn, sang for me this
roundelay: "Rich you are?  And strong
you are?  Good indeed these things to
be.  Beloved by friends is better far.
Take this living truth from me."  Singing,
down the street Truth went.  Others
now will follow fast.  As for me, I am
content&mdash;having learnt his song at last.

<i>MERELY PARENTS</i>

<p>
Lads and lassies, hear our plea&mdash;give
us of your courtesy; we, not you,
need sympathy, being parents.  'Tis a
most exacting age, children are so very
sage, the "complex" now is all the rage,
we're but parents.  Give us, do, a helping
hand.  We would like to understand, we
are such a purblind band, merely parents.
You are witty, clever, wise, source of all
high enterprise, soon you'll be (for Old
Time flies) like us, just parents.  Then
you'll know the self-same fears (aching
heart and unshed tears), having travelled
down the years, as we, your parents.
Then you'll say, as now we do, "We but
long to shelter you, make you love the
good and true, as did our parents."  Lads
and lassies!  Patience show!  Perhaps
we're difficult and slow, but it is
harder than you know&mdash;being parents.

<i>SONG OF THE GIVER</i>

<p>
First there's the joy of choosing.
Now then, what shall it be?&mdash;Useful?
Pretty?  Amusing?  Love chooses
thoughtfully.  Then there's the joy of
paper, green leaves with berries red;
a card with a Christmas taper, tied
with a golden thread.  Then there's the
joy of tying (not string of the common
kind!) ribbons that we've been buying
that glitter as they unwind.  Then there's
the joy of weighing, addressing the label,
too; and, of course, there's the joy of
saying, "With love from me, to you!"  But
nought like the joy of dreaming how
happy that someone will be; how eyes
will be brightly gleaming and mouth
smile happily.  Joy past the power of
rhyming to follow that parcel in thought;
to hear, with gay laughter chiming,
"Look what the postman has brought!"

A steadying hand, a cheerful grin,
"Hold tight," he cries, and helps
us in.  We pay the fare, whate'er it be,
and dream of home and fire and tea.
But not the conductor, no, not he.
Cold or heat, wind or rain, up he goes
and down again; ringing bells, cracking
jokes, helping parcel-burdened folks,
lifting babies with great care, "Where to,
Mum?  Hold tight there."  Answering
questions by the score: "Other way to
Arthur's Store!"  "Full inside, one on
top."  Conductor's duties never stop.
"Hi!  Miss, your purse is on the seat."  Someone
tramps on both his feet.  Jerks
a rope to let him out, then again his
cheery shout, "Hold tight, there!  Fares
please, fares."  Mounts again the winding
stairs, whistling blithely, he runs
down&mdash;cheeriest man in all the town!

When the sun is shining bright,

when the Port of Luck's in sight, then I
turn to you.  For I know you'll laugh
with me, share in full my jollity, and the
world will fairer be&mdash;'cause of you.
When the sun is veiled from sight, when
the clouds of grief hang low, when the
day seems turned to night&mdash;then to you
I go.  For I know you'll comfort me
with a tender sympathy, and the load
will lighter be&mdash;'cause of you.  Not alone
for days serene, not for moments of
success, but a friend you've ever been&mdash;in
joy and in distress.  When the road
was rough and long, you have borne the
journey, too.  So I've made this little
song&mdash;'cause of you.
